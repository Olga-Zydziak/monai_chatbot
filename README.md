# monai_chatbot
A project in which a RAG chatbot is being developed. It uses a closed knowledge base, which is the MONAI project documentation.

## Front-end prototype

The repository also includes a static prototype for the publishing site brief:

- `index.html` – public landing page with tabs and contact form.
- `manager.html` – standalone manager dashboard for editing tab content and gradient styling.
- `scripts/` – shared JavaScript modules powering both views.
